The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.

The Bishop held a meeting there this year and challenged the priest to explain what he d do if a ship s crew came into port who weren t Christian but wanted to pray.Calling Muslim guests to the church  angels , the Bishop later took to her official blog to explain that removing Christian symbols from the church and preparing the building for Muslim prayer doesn t make a priest any less a defender of the faith. Rather, to do any less would make one  stingy towards people of other faiths .The bishop insisted this wasn t an issue, after all airports and hospitals already had multi-faith prayer rooms, and converting the dockyard church would only bring it up to speed. Regardless, the announcement has aroused protest.Father Patrik Pettersson, one of the priests in her diocese and active in the same parish as the Seaman s mission church has hit back in a blog of his own, complaining there is no way you could equate a consecrated church with a prayer room, remarking  I should have thought a bishop would be able to tell the difference .Calling the bishop s words  theologically unthinking , he asked what was to be done with crucifixes screwed to the walls, and heavy items such as baptismal fonts. Ignoring the rhetorical murmuring , Pettersson wrote:  The only argument bishop Eva really put forward in support of her view is  hospitality  How do you respond to that? Not much of a basis for discussion, as one colleague put it.

The contacts, mediated in Oman for years by close colleague of the Sultan, have seen a series of US-Iran prisoner releases, and there may be more to come.The secret back channel of negotiations between Iran and the United States, which led to this month s interim deal in Geneva on Iran s rogue nuclear program, has also seen a series of prisoner releases by both sides, which have played a central role in bridging the distance between the two nations, the Times of Israel has been told.In the most dramatic of those releases, the US in April released a top Iranian scientist, Mojtaba Atarodi, who had been arrested in 2011 for attempting to acquire equipment that could be used for Iran s military-nuclear programs.No wonder he didn t want reporters talking about it!Via: Gateway Pundit\",\n          \"eu un secretarygeneral ban kimoon c meets with greek cypriot president nicos anastasiades l and mustafa akinci r the turkish cypriot leader at the un headquarters in new york september   photo by afp \\ncypriot political leaders have agreed to continue talks in switzerland next month in an attempt to reach an agreement on the reunification of the mediterranean island country the united nations un has announced \\na un spokesman aleem siddique made the announcement on wednesday saying greek cypriot president nicos anastasiades and turkish cypriot leader mustafa akinci will meet at mont pelerin near lake geneva from november  to  \\nsiddique said the two leaders in the presence of the un envoy for cyprus will concentrate their talks on how much territory each side will administer under an envisioned federation and will discuss all other outstanding issues too \\nthe leaders have expressed hope that the switzerland meeting will pave the way for the last phase of talks in line with their shared commitment to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within  the un spokesman said \\nnegotiations on reuniting the mediterranean island under a single federal roof have made significant headway since anastasiades and akinci resumed talks led by the un nearly  months ago \\nhowever important differences still remain on the question of territorial arrangements security and property rights \\nprevious unmediated talks to reunify the mediterranean island faced a deadlock in october  when turkey announced plans to search for oil and gas in waters off cyprus \\ncyprus has been divided since  after an intervention by turkey which came when a military coup was carried out by individuals who sought to unify the island with greece \\nnearly one decade later in  turkish cypriots declared an independent state which has only been recognized by ankara turkey has some  soldiers stationed in the north of that part of cyprus \\ncyprus has been a european union eu member since  but only the south enjoys full membership benefits loading\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.  Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business,  he asserted. Beasley added,  You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.
